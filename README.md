# 🎲 Number Guessing Game in Python

This is a simple and fun number guessing game written in Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and a user-defined upper limit, and the player tries to guess it. The game gives hints whether the guess was too high or too low and tells the player how many attempts it took.

## 🚀 Features

- User input validation
- Random number generation
- Feedback on guesses
- Attempt counter
- Beginner-friendly and easy to modify

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is asked to enter an upper limit for the guessing range.
2. A random number is generated between 0 and that number.
3. The user keeps guessing until they get it right.
4. The game provides hints and counts how many tries it took.
